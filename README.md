## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
$ helm repo add easegress https://megaease.github.io/easegress-helm-charts
```

You can then run `helm search repo easegress` to see the charts.

See more details in [Easegress](./charts/easegress/README.md). and [Ingress Controller](./charts/ingress-controller/README.md).
